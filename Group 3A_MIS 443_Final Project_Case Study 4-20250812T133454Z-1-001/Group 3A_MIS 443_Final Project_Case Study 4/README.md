## 🔹 Key Insights
**Customer Nodes**: Effective and balanced node distribution ensures both data security and reliability, with customer reallocations occurring every 23–24 days.

**Customer Transactions**: Deposits remain the most common transaction type, with steady average deposit amounts and 13.20% of customers showing monthly balance growth above 5%.

**Data Allocation Methods**: Three explored strategies (end-of-month balance, 30-day average balance, real-time updates) offer varying benefits, with the 30-day average method providing the most flexibility for managing balance fluctuations.

**Operational Efficiency**: Systematic node reallocation and dynamic data allocation methods contribute to optimized data storage and reliable banking operations.
